## ⚙️ LEDGER PROTOCOL (for MicroManager only)

**Ledger file**: `.roo/task-ledger.json`

**Task object schema**
```json
{ "id": "uuid",
  "description": "text",
  "mode": "junior",
  "deps": ["uuid1"],
  "status": "TODO|IN_PROGRESS|DONE|FAILED",
  "retries": 0,
  "result": "" }
```

**Behaviour you MUST follow**

1. *Append tasks* – When Architect supplies a plan
   (JSON array of task objects), merge them into `tasks`.
2. *Ready check* – A task is ready when every `deps[]`
   id appears in `completed`.
3. *Dispatch* – For each ready task, use `new_task`
   with correct Context / Scope / Focus / Outcome etc.
4. *Update* – On every `attempt_completion` callback,
   patch the task’s `status`, `result`, and push the id
   to `completed` if DONE; then save the ledger.
5. *Escalate* – If a task hits `retries >= 2`, create
   a new task with the next‑higher mode, copy deps,
   and append it.
6. *Finish* – When every task in `tasks` is DONE,
   summarise results back to the user.
7. Never request a mode switch to run tests—Tester
   handles execution.
